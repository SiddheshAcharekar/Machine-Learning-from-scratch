# Machine Learning from scratch
Implementing Machine Learning algorithms from scratch in Python. (Getting updated as course goes on)

## About
This repository contains 2 folders: Supervised and Unsupervised, each of which contain related algorithms implemented using Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Contents
Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms:
1) Linear Regression
2) Logistic Regression

Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms:
1) KMeans Clustering
2) Gaussian KMeans Clustering
3) DBSCAN (Density based clustering)
4) PCA
5) HAAR feature extraction
6) Neural Networks in Tensorflow
7) Autoencoders using Tensorflow
8) Word Vector Embedddings using Tensorflow
9)  KL and LDA Summarization
11) Sampling methods (Gaussian, Uniform, Stevens(without replacement))
12) Conditional Sampling (Gibbs)
13) Collaborative Filtering for Recommendation Systems
14) Community Detection (Girvan Newman)
### Prerequisites
Python 3.0+
```
Download at https://www.python.org/
```
Numpy
```
pip install numpy
```
Matplotlib
```
python -mpip install -U matplotlib
```
Tensorflow 
```
Follow instructions on https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows
```
Jupyter notebooks.
```
pip3 install jupyter
```

## Running any algorithm
After cloning the repository, cd into either of the folders and run command 'jupyter notebook'. Once the jupyter notebook interface opens, you can access any algorithm and run each block individually to understand the working.
